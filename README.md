# Spark-CodeSpace-Test

This repo shows how we could use github codespaces to create a spark environment, and ask spark related questions.

## Codespaces
https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/getting-started/deep-dive
Codespaces are cloud based environemnts running on containers through github.
This makes it very easy to allow anyone to create a codespace from this repo and have everything they need to program.

This is very similar to Binder which we used to use, but allows us more customisation in the environment the code runs in (e.g. allowing us to install spark) 

## spark_example.ipynb

This contains some example code on how to use spark.
If we can give some example .csv or .parquet file then users can read this data and do some challenges on it.
With the *sparksql_magic* jupyter extension this notebook is very similar to the DataBricks notebooks that we use.

## Usage
To use codespaces with this repo either click the 'Open in GitHub CodeSpaces' badge at the top of this README, or 'Create codespace on main' from the 'Code' button
